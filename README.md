Lab Experiments:

1. Implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file.

2.  For a given set of training data examples stored in a CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination algorithm to output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples

3. Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Back propagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate data sets.

4.. Write a program to implement the na√Øve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets.

5. Write a program to construct a Bayesian network considering medical data. Use this model 5 to demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using standard Heart Disease Data Set.

6. Apply EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file. Use the same data set for clustering using k-Means algorithm. Compare the results of these two algorithms and comment on the quality of clustering.

7. Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify the iris data set. Print both correct and wrong predictions.

8. Implement the non-parametric Locally Weighted Regression algorithm in order to fit data points. Select appropriate data set for your experiment and draw graphs.
